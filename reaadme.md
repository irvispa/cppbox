# Traversal of a binary tree using recursion

This C++ code example demonstrates recursive prefix traversal of a binary tree. The program creates a simple binary tree and uses a recursive function to traverse it.

## Binary tree node structure

The code defines a `TreeNode` structure representing a binary tree node. The node contains data as well as pointers to the left and right subtrees.
